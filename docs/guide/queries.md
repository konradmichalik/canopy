## JQL Examples

### Sprint-based Queries

```sql
-- Current sprint issues
project = "MYPROJECT" AND sprint in openSprints()

-- Specific sprint
project = "MYPROJECT" AND sprint = "Sprint 42"

-- Backlog (no sprint assigned)
project = "MYPROJECT" AND sprint is EMPTY
```

### Team Queries

```sql
-- My open issues
assignee = currentUser() AND resolution is EMPTY

-- Team's in-progress work
project = "MYPROJECT" AND status = "In Progress"

-- Unassigned issues
project = "MYPROJECT" AND assignee is EMPTY
```

### Time-based Queries

```sql
-- Updated this week
project = "MYPROJECT" AND updated >= -7d

-- Created today
project = "MYPROJECT" AND created >= startOfDay()

-- Overdue issues
project = "MYPROJECT" AND duedate < now() AND resolution is EMPTY
```

## Query Separators

Organize your queries with visual separators:

### Adding Separators

1. Click **Add Separator** in the sidebar
2. Optionally enter a title (e.g., "Sprint Queries", "Team Queries")
3. The separator appears in the list

### Managing Separators

- Drag to reorder separators like queries
- Edit to change or add a title
- Delete to remove

**Example organization:**

```
📁 Sprint Queries
   Current Sprint
   Sprint Backlog

📁 Team Queries
   My Issues
   Team Overview
   Unassigned
```

## URL-based Query Selection

Queries generate URL slugs from their titles:

- Query "Current Sprint" → `/current-sprint`
- Query "My Open Issues" → `/my-open-issues`

Share these URLs with team members (they'll need their own Jira credentials).

## Query Persistence

All queries are stored in localStorage and persist across sessions:

- Query titles and JQL
- Colors and order
- Separators and their positions
- Issue counts (cached)

Use [Import/Export](/guide/#import-export) to backup or share your query configuration.
